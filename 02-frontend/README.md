# Exercise 02 â€“ Frontend with React/Next.js

Create a `Posts` component that fetches a list of posts from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` and displays them on screen. You may use React or Next.js.

The skeleton of the component is located in `src/Posts.tsx`. Complete the code marked with `TODO` to fetch the data and render the list.

## Requirements

- Use `fetch` or any library of your choice to retrieve the data.
- Show at least the title of each post.

## How to test

Run this command from the repository root:

```bash
npm test 02-frontend
```

The tests are in `tests/Posts.test.tsx` and check that the component renders the correct number of items.
