# Programming challenges

This repository provides a single exercise.

## Exercises

1. **01-concurrent-fibonacci** â€“ Calculate Fibonacci numbers with concurrent memoization in TypeScript.

Run `npm test` from the repository root to execute the tests.

## Additional Requirement

Create a separate repository using **Next.js** and **NestJS** that implements a multi-step wizard:

1. Ask the customer for their address.
2. Ask how many AC units they have (1, 2, more than 3, or "I don't know").
   - If they select **more than 3** or **I don't know**, navigate to a page where they enter their name and phone number and inform them that we will contact them.
3. If they choose **1** or **2**, let them select the system type (split, package, or "I don't know").
   - Choosing **I don't know** should also lead to the contact page mentioned above.
4. Select the heating type (heat pump or gas).
5. Show a page where they enter their name, phone number, and email.
6. Display a confirmation page after the flow is complete.
7. Integrate a **NestJS** backend. It must use **SQLite** to store user data and expose all APIs needed by the wizard with validations and basic tests. The frontend should call the backend to determine the next step. For example, POST the user's answers to `/api/wizard/next-step` and store contact details through `/api/users`.

You are free to choose the look and feel and any libraries. Use a local database, for example **SQLite**. Provide the code and a README explaining how to run the project, either in a GitHub repository or as a ZIP file. Document how to start both the frontend and the backend.
