# Programming challenges

This repository contains three exercises focused on TypeScript/algorithm skills and basic frontend development with React or Next.js.

## Exercises

1. **01-typescript** – Implement an algorithmic function in TypeScript.
2. **02-frontend** – Build a UI component using React or Next.js.
3. **03-concurrent-fibonacci** – Calculate Fibonacci numbers with concurrent memoization in TypeScript.

Each folder includes a `README.md` with detailed instructions and automated tests you must satisfy.

### General requirements

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the repository root.
2. Implement your solutions inside each folder.
3. Run `npm test` to execute all tests.
4. Create a pull request with your completed solutions once all tests pass.
