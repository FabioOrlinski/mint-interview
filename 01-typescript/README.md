# Exercise 01 â€“ TypeScript & Algorithms

Implement the function `topFrequency(numbers: number[], k: number): number[]` which should return an array with the `k` most frequent numbers in the `numbers` array.

The starter file is in `src/index.ts` with the function signature ready. Complete the code marked with `TODO`.

## Example

```ts
const result = topFrequency([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1], 2);
console.log(result); // [1, 2]
```

## How to test

Run the following from the repository root:

```bash
npm test 01-typescript
```

The tests are located in `tests/index.test.ts` and should pass when your implementation is complete.
